You guys thought this is a Bangladesh Economics Olympiad Website! It might be but..... Hello Everyone I am Md Sanaul Haque Shanto a competitive programmer since 2015, I start coding for gifting animated wishing website, android application and many more. I nor learn coding for making money or have a goal of doing FAANG job. I nealry do have friends I got Computer After my birth, at a time I lost interest to play video games and try to build those stuffs and deleted Windows XP C drive folders a lot of times. Even I have Sony Cybershot camera since 2010 but doing a lot of garbage I try to install Linux and I formated my whole childhood memories (and learn nothing is permanent on digital device and buy a external hard disk). Every loss I got soemthing and learn something. So, live in a tier 1 city I become so lonely I have nothing to do, studing district top school admitted by admission so, i am not a average student! I got top score like A Cambridge Education and A+ in National Education. I do have friends in class 3-8 I lost my best friedn for school politics and I thought I will never make anyone best friends either! then I met a guy who is interested to computer. My older sister learn c programming in 2015 so i interested to learn and saw html is a very funny thing so i can build anything and people can broswer from anywhere so i try to learn html, css, and javascirpt. and my senior year I thought i should love someone ( you know hormone kicks away) and I focused on to make her happy in providing some special animation, applications wishing. I just did this 7 years repeatly and build one software company Partrideg Lab and make $1k+ per month. But notign work and I stopped the company because I am not enjoying to earning this money. and I become single since now! So, one day i went to school and a some university guys promoted programming contest so I particiapted and met a junior guy from my same school who also participated to Programming Contest, then we become friends, and I met another guy who is a bookwarm to read many detective book, history, and manymore. I made him my friends becasue i thought he is a different guy and I am also a different guy. After the programming contest we become so friendly each other and have family relation with all of them because we are from same school and have same idealogis. So, I realized this will be not the same in the future after we graduated we have to leave our place and memories. So, I build a platfrom where I can host any event and I have the reason to talk with my olympiad seniors and juniors and my 2 friends, I didn't build anything for money, fame, attentions, followers, anything just for making a reason to talk.  Then I build a Platform Called ArenaBoard Online Judge in 2018 where anyone can host programming, and quiz competition and have a realtime leaderboard, protored system and many more using Service Oriented Architecture. I host Arenaboard Mega Contest 2018 in december. And my 2 friends job is to upload quizes and extra work nothing related to building/coding or anything. After the mega contest I realozed that I have to make this platform more rich but i don't have any funding or anything even thought 2018 I have cloud platform sponsorship for 2 years (I managed it in 2017). So, i searched for which International Olympiad is not in Bangladesh right now, then I mailed International Academic Research Competiting and they replay that they have another offer from Prothom-Alo and BDOSN. Then I send them the platrom details and they interested to provide ArenaBoard authorization for taking Bangladesh National Event. So, this time I am developing and making new feature for ArenaBoard and maintaing my Education I provide this work to Rafid to handle the outsiders work but all the work handle by me if you see the BDEO 2019 posters have a lot of error, grmmatical errors and my personal phone number, I event posting posters on school, university, Dhaka's English Medium, That Time We apply for ICT division Innovation fund and I give raifd to handle this because I already have all the work. After got the International Authorization I have no fund no economics background so, We try to sick guidence to my high school alumni Dhaka university Economics student Timur he knows a guy who is the Professor of Dhaka School of Economics and he is the guy Md Alamin Parvez. And He make her hand to us that's why we host this and for the 1st year since now Md Alamin Parvez Bro invest his own money for the internationa travels and it's means a lot. Everything that time makes me thing this is magical for me, because I don't have the fund and everything is well finised. along with we got ICT division Fund and this is the main culprit of destroying ArenaBoard. We funly apply to Innovation Fund so I make this to handle Rafid and we got the fund for innovation but our project is ready and propossed project is nothing for us because I have could sponsoriship so most of the fund will not needed for my project so, thought that is should charged for project development and running cost and it tents to the 50% ( but In my mind I thought I should by some printing stuffs (Heatpress, printers, for sublimations printign, t-shirts etc) so we don't have to worry about the goodies So i charged 50% of the fund because i have to market it but then one of our team mate make noise and they didn't heared my (so basicallu my project, Everything is mine but my speach is not recognized) then I said , I will not submit my project code to the ICT division this is my pet project. Then I thought i have nothing now on Dhaka I should go back to my home district and focus on my studies and I am skilled programmar I can make anything anythime. Then I finished Everything form them and live my life. Now I am teacher, Researcher, Programmaer,and ALso I host international Competition Around the world. Nor I have any interest to Bangladesh Economics Olympiad nor I have any benefits to destry them. Even Bangladesh Economics Olympiad logo created by one of my friend Sajid Hasan (Who is also a great Programmer, developed many application, Platform like ACS,and doing fun with Chitti.me). HahA bye!
